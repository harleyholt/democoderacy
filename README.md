# Democoderacy
## The Worlds Nerdliest Game

### What?
Democoderacy (alternately, Nomicode), is a game/experiment of collaberative software development inspired by [Nomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic).

In short, Nomic is a game where every rule is changable. Every turn proposes new rules or rule changes. Ever rule is voted into or out of existence by the players.

Democoderacy is the same idea in the form of this GitHub repo. The code in the repo is the game. All of it is changable (even this README), but only if a majority of the contributors agree to the change.

To start, the code implements the following:
1. Every week on Monday @ 6PM PST, each contributor is awarded 1 to 6 points, randomly chosen for each contributor.
2. Points are awarded in a randomly chosen order.
3. The first contributor to reach 21 points will have their account marked as the winner.
4. The first contributor to be marked as the winner is declared the winner.
